      <description>üöÄ Motivation Having real time inference is crucial for many computer vision models. In some applications, a second delay in inference could mean life or death.&#xA;Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re behind the wheels of a self-driving car and the car takes one full second to detect an oncoming truck. Just one second too late, and you could end up in the clouds üëºüëºüëº&#xA;Or if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky, on the ground.&#xA;I hope that shows you how crucial this problem is.</description>

      <description>üåü Motivation For many data scientist (including myself), we pride ourselves in training a model, seeing the loss graph go down, and claim victory when the test set accuracy reaches 99.99235%.&#xA;Why not?&#xA;This is the after all the juiciest part of the job. &amp;ldquo;Solving&amp;rdquo; one dataset after another, it may seem like anything around you can be conquered with a simple model.fit.&#xA;That was me two years ago.&#xA;The naive version of me thought that was all about it with machine learning (ML).</description>

      <description>üî• Motivation With various high-level libraries like Keras, Transformer, and Fastai, the barrier to training SOTA models has never been lower.&#xA;On top of that with platforms like Google Colab and Kaggle, pretty much anyone can train a reasonably good model using an old laptop or even a mobile phone (with some patience).&#xA;The question is no longer &amp;ldquo;can we train a SOTA model?&amp;rdquo;, but &amp;ldquo;what happens after that?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Unfortunately, after getting the model trained, most people wash their hands off at this point claiming their model works.</description>

      <description>‚è≥ Last Updated: March 27, 2023.&#xA;‚úÖ Motivation As a data scientist, you might be tempted to jump into modeling as soon as you can. I mean, that&amp;rsquo;s the fun part, right?&#xA;But trust me, if you skip straight to modeling without taking the time to really understand the problem and analyze the data, you&amp;rsquo;re setting yourself up for failure.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been there.&#xA;You might feel like a superstar, but you&amp;rsquo;ll have with a model that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</description>

      <description>üî• Motivation After months of searching, you&amp;rsquo;ve finally found the one.&#xA;The one object detection library that just works. No installation hassle, no package version mismatch, and no CUDA errors.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the amazingly engineered YOLOv5 object detection library by Ultralytics.&#xA;Elated, you quickly find an interesting dataset from Roboflow and finally trained a state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLOv5 model to detect firearms from image streams.&#xA;You ran through a quick checklist &amp;ndash;</description>

      <description>üí• Motivation tip&#xA;By the end of this post you will learn how to:&#xA;Set up a Telegram bot with a Python wrapper library. Use the Gradio API to access the GPT-J model prediction. Host the Telegram bot on Hugging Face Spaces. By the end of this post, you&amp;rsquo;ll have your own Telegram bot that has access to the GPT-J-6B model. All for free.&#xA;Deploying a state-of-the-art (SOTA) GPT-like language model on a chatbot can be tricky.</description>

      <description>üîé Motivation tip&#xA;By the end of this post you will learn how to:&#xA;Install the Weights and Biases client and log the YOLOX training metrics. Compare training metrics on Weights and Biases dashboard. Picking the best model with mAP and FPS values. &amp;ldquo;So many models, so little time!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As a machine learning engineer, I often hear this phrase thrown around in many variations.&#xA;In object detection alone, there are already several hundreds of models out there.</description>

      <title>Training a Deep Learning Model for Cell Counting in 17 Lines of Code with 17 Images</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/portfolio/training_dl_model_for_cell_counting/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 15:07:15 +0800</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/portfolio/training_dl_model_for_cell_counting/</guid>
      <description>üï∂Ô∏è Motivation Many biology and medical procedures involve counting cells from images taken with a microscope. Counting cells reveals the concentration of bacteria and viruses and gives vital information on the progress of a disease.&#xA;To accomplish the counting, researchers painstakingly count the cells by hand with the assistance of a device called hemocytometer. This process is repetitive, tedious, and prone to errors.&#xA;What if we could automate the counting by using an intelligent deep learning algorithm instead?</description>

      <description>Introduction So, you‚Äôve trained a deep learning model that can detect objects from images. Next, how can you share the awesomeness of your model with the rest of the world? You might be a PhD student trying to get some ideas from your peers or supervisors, or a startup founder who wishes to share a minimum viable product to your clients for feedback. But, at the same time you don&amp;rsquo;t wish to go through the hassle of dealing with MLOps.</description>
