      <description>ðŸš€ Motivation Having real-time inference is crucial for computer vision applications. In some domains, a 1-second delay in inference could mean life or death.&#xA;Imagine sitting in a self-driving car and the car takes one full second to detect an oncoming speeding truck.&#xA;Just one second too late, and you could end up in the clouds ðŸ‘¼ðŸ‘¼ðŸ‘¼&#xA;Or if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky, you get a very up-close view of the pavement.</description>

      <description>ðŸ”¥ Motivation With various high-level libraries like Keras, Transformer, and Fastai, the barrier to training SOTA models has never been lower.&#xA;On top of that with platforms like Google Colab and Kaggle, pretty much anyone can train a reasonably good model using an old laptop or even a mobile phone (with some patience).&#xA;The question is no longer &amp;ldquo;can we train a SOTA model?&amp;rdquo;, but &amp;ldquo;what happens after that?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Unfortunately, after getting the model trained, most people wash their hands off at this point claiming their model works.</description>
