      <description>üî• Motivation After months of searching, you&amp;rsquo;ve finally found the one.&#xA;The one object detection library that just works. No installation hassle, no package version mismatch, and no CUDA errors.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the amazingly engineered YOLOv5 object detection library by Ultralytics.&#xA;Elated, you quickly find an interesting dataset from Roboflow and finally trained a state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLOv5 model to detect firearms from image streams.&#xA;You ran through a quick checklist &amp;ndash;</description>

      <description>üö¶ Motivation tip&#xA;By the end of this post, you will learn how to:&#xA;Train state-of-the-art YOLOX model with your own data. Convert the YOLOX PyTorch model into ONNX and OpenVINO IR format. Run quantization algorithm to 10x your model&amp;rsquo;s inference speed. P/S: The final model runs faster on the CPU than the GPU! üò±&#xA;Deep learning (DL), seems to be the magic word that makes anything mundane cool again. We find them everywhere - in news reports, blog posts, articles, research papers, advertisements, and even baby books.</description>

      <title>Training a Deep Learning Model for Cell Counting in 17 Lines of Code with 17 Images</title>

      <description>üï∂Ô∏è Motivation Many biology and medical procedures involve counting cells from images taken with a microscope. Counting cells reveals the concentration of bacteria and viruses and gives vital information on the progress of a disease.&#xA;To accomplish the counting, researchers painstakingly count the cells by hand with the assistance of a device called hemocytometer. This process is repetitive, tedious, and prone to errors.&#xA;What if we could automate the counting by using an intelligent deep learning algorithm instead?</description>
