      <description>üî• Motivation After months of searching, you&amp;rsquo;ve finally found the one.&#xA;The one object detection library that just works. No installation hassle, no package version mismatch, and no CUDA errors.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the amazingly engineered YOLOv5 object detection library by Ultralytics.&#xA;Elated, you quickly find an interesting dataset from Roboflow and finally trained a state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLOv5 model to detect firearms from image streams.&#xA;You ran through a quick checklist &amp;ndash;</description>

      <description>üîé Motivation tip&#xA;By the end of this post you will learn how to:&#xA;Install the Weights and Biases client and log the YOLOX training metrics. Compare training metrics on Weights and Biases dashboard. Picking the best model with mAP and FPS values. &amp;ldquo;So many models, so little time!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As a machine learning engineer, I often hear this phrase thrown around in many variations.&#xA;In object detection alone, there are already several hundreds of models out there.</description>

      <description>üö¶ Motivation tip&#xA;By the end of this post, you will learn how to:&#xA;Train state-of-the-art YOLOX model with your own data. Convert the YOLOX PyTorch model into ONNX and OpenVINO IR format. Run quantization algorithm to 10x your model&amp;rsquo;s inference speed. P/S: The final model runs faster on the CPU than the GPU! üò±&#xA;Deep learning (DL), seems to be the magic word that makes anything mundane cool again. We find them everywhere - in news reports, blog posts, articles, research papers, advertisements, and even baby books.</description>

      <title>How to Deploy Object Detection Models on Android with Flutter</title>

      <description>üöë Deployment: Where ML models go to die In this post, I will outline the basic steps to deploy ML models onto lightweight mobile devices easily, quickly and for free.&#xA;tip&#xA;By the end of this post, you will learn about:&#xA;Leveraging Hugging Face infrastructure to host models. Deploying on any edge device using REST API. Displaying the results on a Flutter Android app. According to Gartner, more than 85% of machine learning (ML) models never made it into production.</description>

      <title>Training a Deep Learning Model for Cell Counting in 17 Lines of Code with 17 Images</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/portfolio/training_dl_model_for_cell_counting/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/portfolio/training_dl_model_for_cell_counting/</guid>
      <description>üï∂Ô∏è Motivation Many biology and medical procedures involve counting cells from images taken with a microscope. Counting cells reveals the concentration of bacteria and viruses and gives vital information on the progress of a disease.&#xA;To accomplish the counting, researchers painstakingly count the cells by hand with the assistance of a device called hemocytometer. This process is repetitive, tedious, and prone to errors.&#xA;What if we could automate the counting by using an intelligent deep learning algorithm instead?</description>

      <title>Deploying Object Detection Models on Hugging Face Spaces</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/portfolio/deploy_icevision_models_on_huggingface_spaces/</link>

      <description>Introduction So, you‚Äôve trained a deep learning model that can detect objects from images. Next, how can you share the awesomeness of your model with the rest of the world? You might be a PhD student trying to get some ideas from your peers or supervisors, or a startup founder who wishes to share a minimum viable product to your clients for feedback. But, at the same time you don&amp;rsquo;t wish to go through the hassle of dealing with MLOps.</description>
