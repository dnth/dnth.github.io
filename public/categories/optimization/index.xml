      <description>info&#xA;This blog post is still a work in progress. If you require further clarifications before the contents are finalized, please get in touch with me here, on LinkedIn, or Twitter. üöÄ Motivation - Edge Deployment It&amp;rsquo;s 2024, everyone seems to be talking about complex and larger models.&#xA;Sophisticated models perform well at specific tasks. But they come with the cost of massive computational power.&#xA;Typically that&amp;rsquo;s available in cloud-based environments.</description>

      <description>üöÄ Motivation Real time inference speed is crucial for many applications in production. Some could mean life or death. üíÄ&#xA;Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re behind the wheels of a self-driving car and the car takes 1 second to detect an oncoming truck.&#xA;Just one second too late&amp;hellip; ‚è∞ And you could end up somewhere heavenly&amp;hellip; üëºüëºüëº&#xA;I hope that shows you how crucial this problem is.&#xA;Today (2024), ML models are being deployed in all kinds of high-stakes industries like healthcare, finance, and self-driving cars.</description>
