      <title>Supercharge Your PyTorch Image Models: Bag of Tricks to 8x Faster Inference with ONNX Runtime &amp; Optimizations</title>

      <description>üöÄ Motivation Having real time inference is crucial for many computer vision applications. In some domain, a 1-second delay in inference could mean life or death.&#xA;Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re sitting in a self-driving car and the car takes one full second to detect an oncoming truck.&#xA;Just one second too late, and you could end up in the clouds üëºüëºüëº&#xA;Or if you‚Äôre really lucky, you get a very up-close view of the pavement.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m really excited to tell you that I&amp;rsquo;m one of the top 2% of scientists in the world for 2023, according to Stanford University. It&amp;rsquo;s been ten years of hard work in research and learning, and this award means a lot.&#xA;üõ§Ô∏è The Journey When I started, it was easy.&#xA;I had been in academic for some time as a student and research assistant. And I had the resources, for a good start.</description>

      <description>üåü Motivation For many data scientist (including myself), we pride ourselves in training a model, seeing the loss graph go down, and claim victory when the test set accuracy reaches 99.99235%.&#xA;Why not?&#xA;This is the after all the juiciest part of the job. &amp;ldquo;Solving&amp;rdquo; one dataset after another, it may seem like anything around you can be conquered with a simple model.fit.&#xA;That was me two years ago.&#xA;The naive version of me thought that was all about it with machine learning (ML).</description>

      <description>‚úÖ Motivation In today&amp;rsquo;s world of selfies and Instagram, we all take tons of photos on our phones, cameras, and other gadgets.&#xA;But let&amp;rsquo;s be real, it&amp;rsquo;s easy for our photo collections to become a chaotic mess, making it impossible to find that one special memory.&#xA;I mean, I&amp;rsquo;ve got gigabytes of photos on my Google Photo app filled with dark shots, overly exposed shots, blurry shots, and tons of duplicate stills.</description>

      <description>üî• Motivation With various high-level libraries like Keras, Transformer, and Fastai, the barrier to training SOTA models has never been lower.&#xA;On top of that with platforms like Google Colab and Kaggle, pretty much anyone can train a reasonably good model using an old laptop or even a mobile phone (with some patience).&#xA;The question is no longer &amp;ldquo;can we train a SOTA model?&amp;rdquo;, but &amp;ldquo;what happens after that?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Unfortunately, after getting the model trained, most people wash their hands off at this point claiming their model works.</description>

      <description>‚è≥ Last Updated: March 27, 2023.&#xA;‚úÖ Motivation As a data scientist, you might be tempted to jump into modeling as soon as you can. I mean, that&amp;rsquo;s the fun part, right?&#xA;But trust me, if you skip straight to modeling without taking the time to really understand the problem and analyze the data, you&amp;rsquo;re setting yourself up for failure.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been there.&#xA;You might feel like a superstar, but you&amp;rsquo;ll have with a model that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</description>

      <description>‚ú® Introduction Running AI on the Edge has become a widely discussed topic in the world of artificial intelligence. At its core, the concept of Edge AI involves putting AI algorithms as close to the user or data as possible. This is in contrast to the traditional server-based approach, where computations are carried out in remote servers, leading to slow response times and the need to transfer data back and forth.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/talk_ml_pipelines_from_the_get_go/</guid>
      <description>üí´ Takeaways In this talk, I discussed why ML pipelines should be built from the get-go. Here are some of the key takeaways:&#xA;1Ô∏è‚É£ Despite the hype around machine learning, 55% of companies have not deployed a single ML model yet, and those who have are struggling to maintain and scale them.&#xA;2Ô∏è‚É£ Putting ML in production is not just about ML, but also about engineering. Many companies are doing more engineering than ML to solve various issues that arise in the pipeline.</description>

      <description>üî• Introduction The rapid advancement in computer vision technology has led to the development of sophisticated models that can perform complex tasks, such as object detection and segmentation, with high accuracy. However, these models often require high computational resources and can be slow when running on a CPU. This can pose a challenge for real-time applications, such as surveillance and security, where quick detection and analysis of objects is critical.</description>

      <description>üîé Motivation tip&#xA;By the end of this post you will learn how to:&#xA;Install the Weights and Biases client and log the YOLOX training metrics. Compare training metrics on Weights and Biases dashboard. Picking the best model with mAP and FPS values. &amp;ldquo;So many models, so little time!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As a machine learning engineer, I often hear this phrase thrown around in many variations.&#xA;In object detection alone, there are already several hundreds of models out there.</description>

      <title>Training a Deep Learning Model for Cell Counting in 17 Lines of Code with 17 Images</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/portfolio/training_dl_model_for_cell_counting/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/portfolio/training_dl_model_for_cell_counting/</guid>
      <description>üï∂Ô∏è Motivation Many biology and medical procedures involve counting cells from images taken with a microscope. Counting cells reveals the concentration of bacteria and viruses and gives vital information on the progress of a disease.&#xA;To accomplish the counting, researchers painstakingly count the cells by hand with the assistance of a device called hemocytometer. This process is repetitive, tedious, and prone to errors.&#xA;What if we could automate the counting by using an intelligent deep learning algorithm instead?</description>

      <description>Introduction So, you‚Äôve trained a deep learning model that can detect objects from images. Next, how can you share the awesomeness of your model with the rest of the world? You might be a PhD student trying to get some ideas from your peers or supervisors, or a startup founder who wishes to share a minimum viable product to your clients for feedback. But, at the same time you don&amp;rsquo;t wish to go through the hassle of dealing with MLOps.</description>
