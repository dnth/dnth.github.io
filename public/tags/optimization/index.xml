      <description>ðŸ”¥ Motivation After months of searching, you&amp;rsquo;ve finally found the one.&#xA;The one object detection library that just works. No installation hassle, no package version mismatch, and no CUDA errors.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the amazingly engineered YOLOv5 object detection library by Ultralytics.&#xA;Elated, you quickly find an interesting dataset from Roboflow and finally trained a state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLOv5 model to detect firearms from image streams.&#xA;You ran through a quick checklist &amp;ndash;</description>

      <description>ðŸ”Ž Motivation tip&#xA;By the end of this post you will learn how to:&#xA;Install the Weights and Biases client and log the YOLOX training metrics. Compare training metrics on Weights and Biases dashboard. Picking the best model with mAP and FPS values. &amp;ldquo;So many models, so little time!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As a machine learning engineer, I often hear this phrase thrown around in many variations.&#xA;In object detection alone, there are already several hundreds of models out there.</description>

      <description>ðŸš¦ Motivation tip&#xA;By the end of this post, you will learn how to:&#xA;Train state-of-the-art YOLOX model with your own data. Convert the YOLOX PyTorch model into ONNX and OpenVINO IR format. Run quantization algorithm to 10x your model&amp;rsquo;s inference speed. P/S: The final model runs faster on the CPU than the GPU! ðŸ˜±&#xA;Deep learning (DL), seems to be the magic word that makes anything mundane cool again. We find them everywhere - in news reports, blog posts, articles, research papers, advertisements, and even baby books.</description>
