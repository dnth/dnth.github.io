      <description>🚀 Motivation Real time inference speed is crucial for many applications in production. Some could mean life or death. 💀&#xA;Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re behind the wheels of a self-driving car and the car takes 1 second to detect an oncoming truck.&#xA;Just one second too late&amp;hellip; ⏰ And you could end up somewhere heavenly&amp;hellip; 👼👼👼&#xA;I hope that shows you how crucial this problem is.&#xA;Today (2024), ML models are being deployed in all kinds of high-stakes industries like healthcare, finance, and self-driving cars.</description>

      <description>🔥 Motivation After months of searching, you&amp;rsquo;ve finally found the one.&#xA;The one object detection library that just works. No installation hassle, no package version mismatch, and no CUDA errors.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the amazingly engineered YOLOv5 object detection library by Ultralytics.&#xA;Elated, you quickly find an interesting dataset from Roboflow and finally trained a state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLOv5 model to detect firearms from image streams.&#xA;You ran through a quick checklist &amp;ndash;</description>

      <title>Squeezing the Best Performance Out of YOLOX with Weights and Biases</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/portfolio/comparing_yolox_models_weights_and_biases/</link>

      <description>🔎 Motivation tip&#xA;By the end of this post you will learn how to:&#xA;Install the Weights and Biases client and log the YOLOX training metrics. Compare training metrics on Weights and Biases dashboard. Picking the best model with mAP and FPS values. &amp;ldquo;So many models, so little time!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As a machine learning engineer, I often hear this phrase thrown around in many variations.&#xA;In object detection alone, there are already several hundreds of models out there.</description>

      <description>🚦 Motivation tip&#xA;By the end of this post, you will learn how to:&#xA;Train state-of-the-art YOLOX model with your own data. Convert the YOLOX PyTorch model into ONNX and OpenVINO IR format. Run quantization algorithm to 10x your model&amp;rsquo;s inference speed. P/S: The final model runs faster on the CPU than the GPU! 😱&#xA;Deep learning (DL), seems to be the magic word that makes anything mundane cool again. We find them everywhere - in news reports, blog posts, articles, research papers, advertisements, and even baby books.</description>
