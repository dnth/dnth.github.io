      <description>üöë Deployment: Where ML models go to die In this post, I will outline the basic steps to deploy ML models onto lightweight mobile devices easily, quickly and for free.&#xA;tip&#xA;By the end of this post, you will learn about:&#xA;Leveraging Hugging Face infrastructure to host models. Deploying on any edge device using REST API. Displaying the results on a Flutter Android app. According to Gartner, more than 85% of machine learning (ML) models never made it into production.</description>

      <title>Training a Deep Learning Model for Cell Counting in 17 Lines of Code with 17 Images</title>

      <description>üï∂Ô∏è Motivation Many biology and medical procedures involve counting cells from images taken with a microscope. Counting cells reveals the concentration of bacteria and viruses and gives vital information on the progress of a disease.&#xA;To accomplish the counting, researchers painstakingly count the cells by hand with the assistance of a device called hemocytometer. This process is repetitive, tedious, and prone to errors.&#xA;What if we could automate the counting by using an intelligent deep learning algorithm instead?</description>

      <title>Deploying Object Detection Models on Hugging Face Spaces</title>

      <description>Introduction So, you‚Äôve trained a deep learning model that can detect objects from images. Next, how can you share the awesomeness of your model with the rest of the world? You might be a PhD student trying to get some ideas from your peers or supervisors, or a startup founder who wishes to share a minimum viable product to your clients for feedback. But, at the same time you don&amp;rsquo;t wish to go through the hassle of dealing with MLOps.</description>
