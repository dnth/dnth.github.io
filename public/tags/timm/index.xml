      <description>🚀 Motivation Real time inference speed is crucial for many applications in production. Some could mean life or death. 💀&#xA;Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re behind the wheels of a self-driving car and the car takes 1 second to detect an oncoming truck.&#xA;Just one second too late, and you could end up talking to celestial beings&amp;hellip; 👼👼👼&#xA;Or if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky, on the ground.&#xA;I hope that shows you how crucial this problem is.</description>

      <description>🌟 Motivation For many data scientist (including myself), we pride ourselves in training a model, seeing the loss graph go down, and claim victory when the test set accuracy reaches 99.99235%.&#xA;Why not?&#xA;This is the after all the juiciest part of the job. &amp;ldquo;Solving&amp;rdquo; one dataset after another, it may seem like anything around you can be conquered with a simple model.fit.&#xA;That was me two years ago.&#xA;The naive version of me thought that was all about it with machine learning (ML).</description>

      <description>🔥 Motivation With various high-level libraries like Keras, Transformer, and Fastai, the barrier to training SOTA models has never been lower.&#xA;On top of that with platforms like Google Colab and Kaggle, pretty much anyone can train a reasonably good model using an old laptop or even a mobile phone (with some patience).&#xA;The question is no longer &amp;ldquo;can we train a SOTA model?&amp;rdquo;, but &amp;ldquo;what happens after that?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Unfortunately, after getting the model trained, most people wash their hands off at this point claiming their model works.</description>
