      <description>info&#xA;This blog post is still a work in progress. If you require further clarifications before the contents are finalized, please get in touch with me here, on LinkedIn, or Twitter. ðŸš€ Motivation - Edge Deployment It&amp;rsquo;s late 2023, everyone seems to be talking about complex and larger models.&#xA;Sophisticated models perform well at specific tasks. But they come with the cost of massive computational power.&#xA;Typically that&amp;rsquo;s available in cloud-based environments.</description>

      <description>ðŸŒŸ Motivation For many data scientist (including myself), we pride ourselves in training a model, seeing the loss graph go down, and claim victory when the test set accuracy reaches 99.99235%.&#xA;Why not?&#xA;This is the after all the juiciest part of the job. &amp;ldquo;Solving&amp;rdquo; one dataset after another, it may seem like anything around you can be conquered with a simple model.fit.&#xA;That was me two years ago.&#xA;The naive version of me thought that was all about it with machine learning (ML).</description>

      <description>ðŸ”¥ Motivation With various high-level libraries like Keras, Transformer, and Fastai, the barrier to training SOTA models has never been lower.&#xA;On top of that with platforms like Google Colab and Kaggle, pretty much anyone can train a reasonably good model using an old laptop or even a mobile phone (with some patience).&#xA;The question is no longer &amp;ldquo;can we train a SOTA model?&amp;rdquo;, but &amp;ldquo;what happens after that?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Unfortunately, after getting the model trained, most people wash their hands off at this point claiming their model works.</description>
