### Motivation
Life is short they say. 
So, why waste it to monitor and manually track your deep learning experiments when you can automate it?

How do you select the best model?

In this post you will learn how to
+ Install Weights and Biases
+ Use Wandb with YOLOX
+ Comparing training metrics

And finally get back your life.

A continuation post from...

### Weights and Biases
What. Features.
Installation.

### Monitoring YOLOX Models
Using with YOLOX.
Monitoring metrics.
mAP.

### Comparing Inference Speed
Convert into INT8.
Comparison TLDR.
FPS.
Visual inspection

### Conclusion
Simple easy free.
