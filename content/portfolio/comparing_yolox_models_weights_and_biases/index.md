### üîé Motivation

{{< notice tip >}}
By the end of this post you will learn how to:
+ Install the Wandb client and log the YOLOX training metrics to Wandb.
+ Compare training metrics on Wandb dashboard.
+ Picking the best model from mAP and FPS values.

"**So many models, so little time!**"

As a machine learning engineer, I often hear this phrase thrown around in many variations.

In object detection alone, there are already several hundreds of models out there. 
With each passing day, better models are added as new discoveries are made.
If you're new, this can easily get overwhelming.

Even within the YOLOX series there are 6 variations of the model to choose from.
There are 3 questions that beg answering:

+ How do you pick the best model?
+ How do the models compare to one another?
+ How do you keep track and log the performance of each model?

In this blog post I will show you how I accomplish all of them by using a free and simple tool from [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/home) (Wandb) üëá

**PS**: No Excel sheets involved.

### üìâ Wandb - Google Drive for Machine Learning


Life is short they say. So why waste it on monitoring your deep learning models when you can automate them?
This is what Wandb is trying to solve. It's like Google Drive for machine learning.

Wandb helps individuals and teams build models faster.
With just few lines of code, you can compare models, log important metrics, and collaborate with teammates.
It's free to get started. Click [here](https://wandb.ai/) to create an account.

This post is a sequel to my previous post where I showed [how to deploy YOLOX models on CPU at 50 FPS](https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/how_to_10x_your_od_model_and_deploy_50fps_cpu/).
This time around I will show you how I get the most from the YOLOX models by logging the performance metrics and comparing them on Wandb.

Let's first install the Wandb client for `Python`:

``` bash
pip install wandb
```

Next, run 
```bash
wandb login
```
from your terminal to authenticate your machine. The API key is stored in `~/.netrc`.

### üëÄ Monitoring Training Metrics

### ‚õ≥Ô∏è Wrapping up
Simple easy free.
