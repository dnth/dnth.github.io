### üî• Motivation
SOTA models usually take a lot of resources to run.

Putting complicated model on mobile is painful.

With [TorchScript](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html) its possible.

{{< notice tip >}}
By the end of this post you will learn how to:
+ Train a SOTA ConvNext from TIMM for free on Kaggle.
+ Export the trained model into TorchScript.
+ Create a beaufiful UI and run the model on your Android device with Flutter.

### ü•á PyTorch Image Models

PyTorch Image Models or [TIMM](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) is an open source computer vision library by Ross Wightman.

The TIMM repository hosts hundreds of recent SOTA models maintained by Ross.



### üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Training with Fastai and TIMM
Using Jeremy's Kaggle notebook.

Convnext for paddy disease classification.

TIMM model

Top results in leaderboard.


### üìÄ Exporting to TorchScript

All the models on TIMM can be exported to TorchScript

### üì≤ Inference in Flutter
