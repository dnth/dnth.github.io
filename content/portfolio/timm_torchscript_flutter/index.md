### üî• Motivation
You finally got into a Kaggle competition. You found a *getting-started notebook* written by a Kaggle Grandmaster and immediately trained a state-of-the-art (SOTA) image classification model.

After some fiddling, you found yourself in the leaderboard topping the charts with **99.9851247\% accuracy** on the test set!

Proud of your achievement you reward yourself to some rest and a good night's sleep. 

And then..

{{< figure_resizing src="meme_sleep.jpg" >}}

<!-- I hope this doesn't keep you awake at night like it did for me. -->

With various high level libraries like Keras, Transformer and Fastai, the barrier to SOTA models have never been lower.

On top of that with platforms like Colab and Kaggle, pretty much anyone can train a reasonably good model using an old laptop or even a mobile phone (with some patience).

The question is no longer "*can we train a SOTA model?*", but "*what happens after that?*"

Unfortunately, after getting the model trained, majority data scientists wash their hands off at this point claiming their model works. 

The proof? üëâ Kaggle leaderboard.

But, what good would SOTA models do if it's just in notebooks and Kaggle leaderboards?
Unless the model is deployed and put to use, it's of limited benefit to anyone out there.

{{< figure_resizing src="meme.jpg" >}}

But deployment is painful. Running a model on a mobile phone? 

Forget it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

The frustration is real. I remember spending nights exporting models into ONNX and it still fails me.

Deployment on mobile doesn't need to be complicated.

In this post I'm going to show you how you can pick from over 600+ SOTA models and deploy them on Android, for free.

<!-- With [TorchScript](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html) its possible. -->

{{< notice tip >}}
By the end of this post you will learn how to:
+ Train a SOTA ConvNeXt from TIMM for free on Kaggle.
+ Export the trained model into TorchScript.
+ Create a beaufiful UI and run the model on your Android device with Flutter.

üí°**NOTE**: If you already have a [TIMM](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) model feel free to jump straight into [üìÄ Exporting to TorchScript](https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/timm_torchscript_flutter/#-exporting-to-torchscript) section.

<!-- You might wonder, do I need to learn ONNX? TensorRT? TFLite?

Maybe.

Learning each on of them takes time. Personally, I never had a very positive experience with exporting PyTorch models into ONNX.
It doesn't work every time. -->
<!-- I had to pull my hair over sleepless nights exporting to ONNX.
They are out of the PyTorch ecosystem. -->

<!-- But in this post I will show you solution that holds the best chances of working - TorchScript. -->
<!-- Integrated within the PyTorch ecosystem. -->



But, if you'd like to discover how I train a model using some of the best techniques on Kaggle, read on üëá

### ü•á PyTorch Image Models

PyTorch Image Models or [TIMM](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) is an open source computer vision library by Ross Wightman.

The TIMM repository hosts hundreds of recent SOTA models maintained by Ross.
At this point we have 645 pretrained model on TIMM. Increasing daily.

Other than models TIMM also provides layers, utilities, optimizers, schedulers, data-loaders, augmentations


```bash
pip install timm
```

We can use training script in TIMM and it give you the SOTA results.
TIMM has a lot of advanced techniques, layers, optmizers and so on.

But if you're just exploring and learning, it can take a long time to learn all that. 

If you don't have a lot of time to learn and just want to start training immediately to see how things work, meet Fastai.


### üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Training with Fastai 
Top down learning approach. Learn by doing. You don't need to be a PhD or a "math person".

[Intro to fastai](https://www.fast.ai/2020/02/13/fastai-A-Layered-API-for-Deep-Learning/)

A kid learns to throw a ball by throwing, not learn physics first.

How do we effectively train a model from TIMM?

Fastai has all the best practices that allows you to train any TIMM models and achieve top ranks in Kaggle leaderboards.

Using Jeremy's Kaggle notebook.

### üìÄ Exporting to TorchScript

{{% blockquote author="TorchScript Docs" %}}
TorchScript is a way to create serializable and optimizable models from PyTorch code.
{{% /blockquote %}}



All the models on TIMM can be exported to TorchScript


```python
import torch
from torch.utils.mobile_optimizer import optimize_for_mobile

model = torch.load('model_scripted.pt',map_location="cpu")
model.eval()
example = torch.rand(1, 3, 224, 224)
traced_script_module = torch.jit.trace(model, example)
optimized_traced_model = optimize_for_mobile(traced_script_module)
optimized_traced_model._save_for_lite_interpreter("model.pt")

```



### üì≤ Inference in Flutter

We will be using the [pytorch_lite](https://github.com/zezo357/pytorch_lite) Flutter package.

Supports object classification and detection with TorchScript.
