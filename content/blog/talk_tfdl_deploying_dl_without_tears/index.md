### Introduction
This is a talk given to the Tensorflow Deep Learning Malaysia Facebook [group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TensorFlowMY/) with over 7.5k members.

The goal of the talk is to introduce the members to existing open-source tools they can use to deploy models on the cloud and edge.

Half of the audience has no experience with deep learning. 
Hence, the talk was tailored to beginners in the field.

### The Deep Gap
I started the talk by introducing my background and experience in the field.

### Technical Walkthrough

#### Cloud Deployment

#### Edge Deployment

### Conclusion
