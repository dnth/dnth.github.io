### ðŸ”¥ Introduction
The rapid advancement in computer vision technology has led to the development of sophisticated models that can perform complex tasks, such as object detection and segmentation, with high accuracy. However, these models often require high computational resources and can be slow when running on a CPU. This can pose a challenge for real-time applications, such as surveillance and security, where quick detection and analysis of objects is critical.

In this talk, we will discuss a demonstration of detecting pistols in real-time using a CPU. We will also outline the methodology and lessons learned from this project and provide some advice for those looking to implement similar computer vision models on a CPU.
