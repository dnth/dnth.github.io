### Introduction

On October 28th, 2024 I made it to GitHub Trending! This wasnt something I expected to happen, and I'm still in disbelief.

But after all the dopamine rush, I'm back to reality and I want to share my journey on how I made it. This is mostly a note to myself and I hope it can help you too.

### The Project - x.infer

{{< githubRepoCard "dnth/x.infer" >}}

I created a project called x.infer. It's a framework agnostic computer vision inference library. I wanted to make it easier to use different image models without the hassle of switching between frameworks.

That was the initial goal.



### The Road to Trending

Firstly, I don't think that starting a project with the goal of getting it trending is a good idea. The goal should be much bigger than that. And getting trending is just a bonus.

Plus, putting an expectation on be on trending makes you more likely to get disappointed when it doesn't happen.

Start with a goal to solve a pain point.

#### Solving a Pain Point
The first step to getting your project trending is to solve a pain point. This is not something that you'll know until you've been working in the field for a while.

For me, computer vision is my interest and I've been using many image models for different tasks. 

One pattern emerged, there are many frameworks, and each framework has its own way of loading the model, inference, and post-processing, etc. 

Putting this into a single package would be super useful.

#### The README File
This is probably the most important part of the project aside from solving a pain point.

Nobody would know about what pain point you're solving if you don't tell them in a way that's easy to understand.

#### The Demo Video
To support the README file, I also created a demo video to showcase the project. This made it even clearer to understand what the project does. 

People are visual creatures they said and I find this to be true. And also visuals convey more information than words and in a shorter time.

#### The Community

I did not post about this project on social media in one go. Instead I posted about it in a niche community to get some initial feedback.

I posted on Reddit and got some good feedback.
