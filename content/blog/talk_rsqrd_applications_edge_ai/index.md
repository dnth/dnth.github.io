Edge AI refers to the deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms and models at the edge of the network, closer to the source of data, rather than in a centralized cloud or data center. This allows for real-time analysis and decision making without the latency and bandwidth limitations of sending data back and forth to a central location. 

Edge AI is important because it enables IoT devices, such as cameras and sensors, to process data locally and respond quickly to changing conditions without relying on a constant connection to the cloud. This can lead to improved efficiency, security, and privacy, as well as enabling new use cases for AI in areas such as autonomous vehicles and industrial control systems.

In this talk, I discuss importance and applications of Edge AI with Sage Elliot from [Whylabs](https://whylabs.ai/).
