### 💫 Takeaways 
In this talk, I discussed why ML pipelines should be built from the get-go. Here are some of the key takeaways:

1️⃣ Despite the hype around machine learning, 55% of companies have not deployed a single ML model yet, and those who have are struggling to maintain and scale them.

2️⃣ Putting ML in production is not just about ML, but also about engineering. Many companies are doing more engineering than ML to solve various issues that arise in the pipeline.

3️⃣ There are many ML Ops tools and platforms available, but this can be overwhelming and disorienting for beginners. It's important to start with a clear plan and a focus on the most critical parts of the pipeline.

4️⃣ Data cleaning and preprocessing can take up to 80% of the data scientist's time, so it's important to have efficient processes and tools to handle this.

Watch the full video to learn more about these challenges and how to tackle them! 🎥👨‍🏫
