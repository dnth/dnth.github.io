I'm really excited to tell you that I'm one of the top 2% of scientists in the world for 2023, according to Stanford University. It's been ten years of hard work in research and learning, and this award means a lot.

### 🛤️ The Journey
When I started, it wasn't easy. 

There were tough times and I sometimes wondered if I could do it. If you're researching or studying and it feels tough, keep going. The hard work is worth it because of all the good things you learn and do along the way.

### 🚀 Transition to Industry
Moving from university to working in business was a big change. 

I didn't have much experience outside of school, but I learned that the way you learn to think in research is very helpful in business too.

### 💡 Critical Skills and Mindset
Being able to think through problems and figure out how to solve them is a big deal in any job. 

These skills from university have helped me a lot in the business world, and they help you keep learning new things too.

### 🙏 Acknowledgments
I want to say a big thank you to the people I work with, my mentors, and my teachers, especially at Universiti Tenaga Nasional. They've all helped me get here.

### 🌱 Conclusion
Getting this award shows that sticking with it and working hard can lead to great things. 

I hope this encourages you to keep on with your own work and chase your goals.
