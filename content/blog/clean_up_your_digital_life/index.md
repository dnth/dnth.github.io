### ‚úÖ Motivation

In today's world of selfies and Instagram, we all take tons of photos on our phones, cameras, and other gadgets. But let's be real, it's easy for our photo collections to become a chaotic mess, making it impossible to find that one special memory. 

I‚Äôve had gigabytes in my Google Photo filled with dark shots taken accidentally, overly exposed shots, blurry shots, and tons of duplicate shots. Let‚Äôs be honest, we all tap on the camera button multiple times to take burst shots in an attempt to capture the best look.

Why photo organization is important

- Disorganized photos make it difficult to find specific photos when you need them.
- Photo organization saves time and energy when searching for specific photos.
- Digital clutter can take up valuable storage space on your devices, which can slow down their performance.
- A well-organized digital photo collection can be a source of pride and enjoyment.
- It's easier to share organized photos with others through social media or physical photo albums or prints.

Sorting through your photos and deleting unwanted photos can be a time-consuming task and nobody wants to spend hours doing just that. We‚Äôre busy people.

Don't fret, though! With a few easy-peasy steps, you can declutter your photo library and say goodbye to the headache of searching for your favorite pics. In this article, we'll show you how to tidy up your digital life by organizing your photo collection.

This blog will demonstrate how to use Fastup to effectively clean up your photo collection through programming. 

{{< notice tip >}}
We will cover the following topics:

- Identifying duplicate or nearly identical photos.
- Grouping similar photos together and selectively deleting them.
- Filtering out photos that are too dark, too bright, or blurry.


üìù **NOTE**: All codes used in the post are on my [Github repo](https://github.com/dnth/clean-up-digital-life-fastdup-blogpost). Alternatively, you can [run this example in Colab](https://github.com/dnth/fastdup-manage-clean-curate-blogpost/blob/main/clean.ipynb).

If you have a messy photo collection, you can manually go through the images and remove them one by one. I've done that myself.

But if you have thousands of them.. It will take forever. 
And why do it manually when you can get a machine to do it for you?

It's easy to get started and use. 
The [authors of Fastdup](https://www.visual-layer.com/) even used it to uncover over **1.2M duplicates** and **104K data train/validation leaks** in the ImageNet-21K dataset [here](https://medium.com/@amiralush/large-image-datasets-today-are-a-mess-e3ea4c9e8d22).


If all that looks interesting, let's get started with..

### ‚òï Messy Images

As we are going to clean up messy albums, the first step is to download the photos from your Google Photos, Onedrive or wherever you have your images into your local drive.

I don't have a massive photo collection, so I‚Äôll be using a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/duttadebadri/image-classification) that was scraped off Google Download them into a folder on your computer. The contributor [Debadri Dutta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/debadridtt/) has a knack of photography and travelling. 

Here are a few sample images.

{{< figure_resizing src="sample.png" caption="Sample images scraped from Google." link="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/duttadebadri/image-classification" >}}


With the images downloaded locally let's organize them in a folder.
Here's how the folders look on my computer.

```tree
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fastdup_report
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fastdup_analyze.ipynb
```

{{< notice note >}}
Description -
+ `images/` -- Folder to store the images.
+ `fastdup_report/` -- Directory to save the output generated by Fastdup.
+ `fastdup_analyze.ipynb` -- Jupyter notebook to run Fastdup.

üìù **NOTE**: If you'd like to follow along with the example on this post download the images into your desktop from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/duttadebadri/image-classification) into the `images/` directory.
