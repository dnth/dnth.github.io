### ‚úÖ Motivation

In today's world of selfies and Instagram, we all take tons of photos on our phones, cameras, and other gadgets. But let's be real, it's easy for our photo collections to become a chaotic mess, making it impossible to find that one special memory. 

I‚Äôve had gigabytes in my Google Photo filled with dark shots taken accidentally, overly exposed shots, blurry shots, and tons of duplicate shots. Let‚Äôs be honest, we all tap on the camera button multiple times to take burst shots in an attempt to capture the best look.

Why photo organization is important

- Disorganized photos make it difficult to find specific photos when you need them.
- Photo organization saves time and energy when searching for specific photos.
- Digital clutter can take up valuable storage space on your devices, which can slow down their performance.
- A well-organized digital photo collection can be a source of pride and enjoyment.
- It's easier to share organized photos with others through social media or physical photo albums or prints.

Sorting through your photos and deleting unwanted photos can be a time-consuming task and nobody wants to spend hours doing just that. We‚Äôre busy people.
