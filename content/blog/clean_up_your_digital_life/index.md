### ‚úÖ Motivation

In today's world of selfies and Instagram, we all take tons of photos on our phones, cameras, and other gadgets. But let's be real, it's easy for our photo collections to become a chaotic mess, making it impossible to find that one special memory. 

I‚Äôve had gigabytes in my Google Photo filled with dark shots taken accidentally, overly exposed shots, blurry shots, and tons of duplicate shots. Let‚Äôs be honest, we all tap on the camera button multiple times to take burst shots in an attempt to capture the best look.

Why photo organization is important

- Disorganized photos make it difficult to find specific photos when you need them.
- Photo organization saves time and energy when searching for specific photos.
- Digital clutter can take up valuable storage space on your devices, which can slow down their performance.
- A well-organized digital photo collection can be a source of pride and enjoyment.
- It's easier to share organized photos with others through social media or physical photo albums or prints.

Sorting through your photos and deleting unwanted photos can be a time-consuming task and nobody wants to spend hours doing just that. We‚Äôre busy people.

Don't fret, though! With a few easy-peasy steps, you can declutter your photo library and say goodbye to the headache of searching for your favorite pics. In this article, we'll show you how to tidy up your digital life by organizing your photo collection.

This blog will demonstrate how to use Fastup to effectively clean up your photo collection through programming.

We will cover the following topics:

- Identifying duplicate or nearly identical photos.
- Grouping similar photos together and selectively deleting them.
- Filtering out photos that are too dark, too bright, or blurry.


üìù **NOTE**: All codes used in the post are on my [Github repo](https://github.com/dnth/clean-up-digital-life-fastdup-blogpost). Alternatively, you can [run this example in Colab](https://github.com/dnth/fastdup-manage-clean-curate-blogpost/blob/main/clean.ipynb).

If you have a messy photo collection, you can manually go through the images and remove them one by one. I've done that myself.

But if you have thousands of them.. It will take forever. 
And why do it manually when you can get a machine to do it for you?

Let me introduce you to üëá

### ‚ö° Fastdup

Fastdup is a tool that let us gain insights from a large image/video collection. 
You can manage, clean, and curate your images at scale on your local machine with a single CPU.
It's incredibly easy to use and highly efficient. 

Fastdup lets me clean my visual data with ease, freeing up valuable resources and time. 

Here are some superpowers you get with Fastdup.
It lets you identify:

In short, Fastdup is üëá
* **Unsupervised**: fits any visual dataset.
* **Scalable**: handles 400M images on a single machine.
* **Efficient**: works on CPU (even on Google Colab with only 2 CPU cores!).
* **Low Cost**: can process 12M images on a $1 cloud machine budget.

The best part? Fastdup is **free**. 

It's easy to get started and use. 
The [authors of Fastdup](https://www.visual-layer.com/) even used it to uncover over **1.2M duplicates** and **104K data train/validation leaks** in the ImageNet-21K dataset [here](https://medium.com/@amiralush/large-image-datasets-today-are-a-mess-e3ea4c9e8d22).


Now it's time to take on the huge task of cleaning up the...

You can download the photos from your Google Photos, Onedrive or wherever you have your images into your local drive.

I don't have a massive photo collection, so I‚Äôll be using a dataset from Kaggle that was scraped off Google Download them into a folder on your computer.

Here's how the folders look on my computer.
