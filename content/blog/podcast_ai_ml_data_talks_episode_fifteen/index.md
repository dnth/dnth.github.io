In this episode of the AI/ML talk I talked about some of the hottest topics in machine learning including 
What is MLOps?
Data Drift vs Concept Drift and 
Monitoring Machine Learning Model.

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices for managing the lifecycle of machine learning models in production. It involves collaboration between data scientists, software engineers, and IT operations teams to automate and streamline the process of developing, deploying, and maintaining machine learning models.

Data drift refers to the gradual change in the statistical properties of the data used to train a machine learning model over time, which can affect the model's accuracy. Concept drift, on the other hand, refers to a change in the underlying problem the model is trying to solve, which can also impact its accuracy.

Monitoring a machine learning model involves continuously evaluating its performance on fresh data and detecting any signs of degradation or drift. This can involve tracking key metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, as well as implementing retraining and updating strategies to ensure the model remains relevant and effective over time. Monitoring is a critical component of MLOps, as it helps to ensure the model's continued performance and helps to identify when it may need to be updated or replaced.
