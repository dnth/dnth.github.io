### Introduction
I was recently given the recognition by the folks at IceVision to be part of the core-developer team!

### Lessons Learned
Here are some of the lessons I learned along the way that changed me in so many ways.
I have been coding for more than 10 years now. However, this experience have changed me in many ways.
I wish I had started earlier. If you are new and want to contribute to open source, start now.

#### A Better Coder
I have spent more than 10 years coding and dabbled in many projects since my student years.
I did not know how good or bad my code was. 
Sometimes the codes didn't work out and I don't know why and sometimes things work and I still don't know why.
There was no feedback or anyone who could guide me because nobody knows enough to help other than myself. 
This is a major difference when I learn in private and public.
First, learning in public is powerful compared to learning in private.
