### Introduction
I was recently given the recognition by the folks at IceVision to be part of the core-developer team!
[Farid Hassainia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farid-hassainia-ca/), a co-creator of the IceVision Tweeted about it on March 17, 2022.

### Lessons learned
Looking back at how far I came, I was astonished.
It was just 3 months back that I learned how to open a *Pull Request* on GitHub. 
Despite having coded for over 10 years, I have never bothered to learn about something so commonly used in the software world - Git, a version control system.
I took the plunge, and the first step was painful. 
But every subsequent step got better and better. I never looked back since.
Here are some of the lessons I learned along the way that changed the way I learn and write code.
I wish I had started earlier. 
If you are new and want to contribute to open source, start now.

#### üßë‚Äçüîß I became a better coder
I've spent years coding and dabbled in many projects since I was a student.
With so much time spent on coding, one would be expected to have a good grasp on it.
But in reality, I didn't know how good or bad my codes were. 
Or whether the codes are of best practices or optimal in any way given that a significant portion of the codes were taken off snippets from various sources like Stackoverflow, blog posts and even GitHub.
Most of the time, when the code works, I leave it as it is, and when it doesn't, I try to troubleshoot to the best of my ability.
I can recall on numerous occasions when my codes didn't work out, and I didn't know why. 
And sometimes the codes worked, and I still have no idea why ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
Because the codes were not publicly shared, there were very limited feedback or insights that anyone can offer to improve them even when I asked for help.
As a result, bugs in the codes remained bugs, and it never got fixed.
This had severely limited what I could have learned and gained had I gotten better feedback by sharing my codes publicly.
This is the major difference of learning in private and in public.

Learning in public is many times more powerful compared to learning in private.
Nowadays, it's so easy to start learning in public by contributing to open-source software.
All you got to do is pick the one you are most interested in and start engaging the community around the project.
For me, the project that got me interested was [IceVision](https://airctic.com/0.12.0/).
At first all I did was try to use the library for my own side projects.
Gradually, I realized there are things that I could not do with the library and started asking for help from the community.
This is how I discovered that there are ways I can contribute to the library by adding the features I needed.
With IceVision, I have always wanted to use [Transformer](https://github.com/SwinTransformer/Swin-Transformer-Object-Detection) for object detection tasks. However, that was not included in the library at that point.
I then started to research and ask for help on how to include that model into the library.
That was the beginning of how I started contributing to the library.
I ended up adding more than 10 models to the library in 14 pull requests. 
A dozen commits and thousands of lines of codes later, I became an active contributor to the library. The rest is history.

Little that I know, I was also ranked #26 on [Top GitHub Users By Country](https://github.com/gayanvoice/top-github-users/blob/main/markdown/public_contributions/malaysia.md) out of 1000+ contributors from Malaysia. 
The ranking is based on the amount of public contribution on GitHub.
All these happened within a short span of 3 months!

#### üë®‚Äçüè´ I got mentorship from coding experts
Getting a mentor is no doubt one of the best investments for rapid progress in any areas of personal growth.
Ask any successful figures for advice, and getting mentors will surely top the list.
In my journey of contributing to open-source one of the most rewarding experience is the opportunity to learn from the maintainers of the library as they help and guide me to contribute to the library.
More often than not, these maintainers (especially for reputable packages) are highly experienced coders.

On one occasion, I got the opportunity to get on a video call with Farid to discuss on how to fix an issue with the newly added features of IceVision.
Even though our interactions were purely online, I got a glimpse into his thought process he explained how things are done.
Needless to say, I learned a lot, not only on the technical aspect but also on the elusive non-technical side such as the mindset of a developer.
Farid was also kind enough to offer me practical advice on how to stand out as a developer and encouraged me to blog about what I learned.
This blog exists thanks to his advice and encouragement.

As I familiarize myself more with the library, I also have had many opportunities to help others who are struggling with the same problems I had.
In the process of helping others solve their problems, I often find myself learning new things and exploring areas I never bother to look into.
As I help others, I gained and learned a lot myself.
One day I hope to be a mentor of some sort to others and help inspire them in the ways I was inspired too.

#### üåé I started a website from scratch
Encouragement from Farid led me to start blogging.
In the process, I explored and learned how to use several blogging platform including Wordpress, Ghost, and Hugo.
I finally settled with Hugo as it gives the best flexibility for my use case.
In the process, I also learned about self-hosting a webpage on GitHub and Digital Ocean, purchasing a domain, GitHub pages, and workflows.
The learning curve was steep, but it's well worth it.

Additionally, in the process of blogging, I also realized that writing about something really helped me solidify and clarify my understanding of the things I write about.
More often than not, I find myself in the illusion of understanding something when I really don't.
This will only be evident when I start writing about it.

Learning by writing is also a form of active learning as opposed to passively absorbing content.
This has significantly improved my understanding of many concepts I thought I already knew.

Apart from that, I also shared my blog posts on Twitter and LinkedIn which resulted in online presence and visibility of my blog.
Once again the IceVision community is very kind to share my posts and provided me some valuable feedbacks.


#### üôå I learned about the kindness of strangers
I have learned that there are a lot of kind people out there who are willing to help.
IceVision community has many.
Expanding my horizon to knowing people from around the world.
Build self confidence and self esteem.
I have known many kind people from the IceVision community who are willing to help.
I gained a few friends.
I attended a few interviews.
I got to expand my social circle.



### Wrapping up
Its a wrap! Contributing to open source has changed by perspective quite a bit in a merely short 3 months.
