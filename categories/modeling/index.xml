Counting cells reveals the concentration of bacteria and viruses and gives vital information on the progress of a disease. To accomplish the counting, a device known as the hemocytometer or a counting chamber is used. The hemocytometer creates volumetric grid to divide each region on the image for accurate counting.
The following YouTube video illustrates the counting process using a hemocytometer.</description></item></channel></rss>
