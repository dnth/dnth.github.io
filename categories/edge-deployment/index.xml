Sophisticated models perform well at specific tasks. But they come with the cost of massive computational power.
Typically that&amp;rsquo;s available in cloud-based environments. Cloud-based environments has limitations, such as latency, bandwidth constraints, and privacy concerns.
This is when edge deployment comes into play.
In simple terms, edge deployment means running a model close to the source of the data.</description></item></channel></rss>
