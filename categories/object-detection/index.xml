Counting cells reveals the concentration of bacteria and viruses and gives vital information on the progress of a disease. To accomplish the counting, researchers painstakingly count the cells by hand with the assistance of a device called hemocytometer. This process is repetitive, tedious, and prone to errors.
What if we could automate the counting by using an intelligent deep learning algorithm instead?</description></item><item><title>Real-time Vehicle and License Plate Detection with Tensorflow and OpenVINO</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/realtime_vehicle_and_license_plate_detection_with_openvino/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2022 15:07:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/realtime_vehicle_and_license_plate_detection_with_openvino/</guid><description>Motivation In this work we showcase a real-time vehicle and license plate detection using
