ML model adds value to a business or organization when it can make its prediction available to users. This is where deployment comes in. 80 percent of models don&amp;rsquo;t make it into prod.
Deploying deep learning model on the edge is not trivial.</description></item><item><title>Deploy IceVision Models on HuggingFace Spaces</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/deploy_icevision_models_on_huggingface_spaces/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 13:42:56 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/deploy_icevision_models_on_huggingface_spaces/</guid><description>Introduction So, youâ€™ve trained a deep learning model that can detect objects from images. Next, how can you share the awesomeness of your model with the rest of the world? You might be a PhD student trying to get some ideas from your peers or supervisors, or a startup founder who wishes to share a minimum viable product to your clients for feedback. But, at the same time you don&amp;rsquo;t wish to go through the hassle of dealing with MLOps.</description></item></channel></rss>
