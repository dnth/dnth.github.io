On top of that with platforms like Google Colab and Kaggle, pretty much anyone can train a reasonably good model using an old laptop or even a mobile phone (with some patience).
The question is no longer &amp;ldquo;can we train a SOTA model?&amp;rdquo;, but &amp;ldquo;what happens after that?&amp;rdquo;
Unfortunately, after getting the model trained, most people wash their hands off at this point claiming their model works.</description></item><item><title>fastdup: A Powerful Tool to Manage, Clean &amp; Curate Visual Data at Scale on Your CPU - For Free.</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/fastdup_manage_clean_curate/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 11:00:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/fastdup_manage_clean_curate/</guid><description>✅ Motivation As a data scientist, you might be tempted to jump into modeling as soon as you can. I mean, that&amp;rsquo;s the fun part, right?
But trust me, if you skip straight to modeling without taking the time to really understand the problem and analyze the data, you&amp;rsquo;re setting yourself up for failure.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been there.
You might feel like a superstar, but you&amp;rsquo;ll have with a model that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work 🤦‍♂️.</description></item><item><title>Bringing High-Quality Image Models to Mobile: Hugging Face TIMM Meets Android &amp; iOS</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/bringing_high_quality_image_models_to_mobile/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Feb 2022 11:00:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/bringing_high_quality_image_models_to_mobile/</guid><description>info

Bob had been working on a project to build a model that could identify different types of fruits, from apples to pineapples. He spent countless hours training and fine-tuning the model until it could recognize fruits with 98% accuracy.</description></item></channel></rss>
