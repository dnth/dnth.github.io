&lt;p>Having real-time inference is crucial for computer vision applications.
In some domains, a 1-second delay in inference could mean life or death.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Imagine sitting in a self-driving car and the car takes &lt;strong>one full second&lt;/strong> to detect an oncoming speeding truck.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just one second too late, and you could end up in the clouds 👼👼👼&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky, you get a very up-close view of the pavement.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bringing High-Quality Image Models to Mobile: Hugging Face TIMM Meets Android &amp; iOS</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/bringing_high_quality_image_models_to_mobile/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Mar 2023 11:00:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/bringing_high_quality_image_models_to_mobile/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="-motivation">🌟 Motivation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For many data scientist (including myself), we pride ourselves in training a model, seeing the loss graph go down, and claim victory when the test set accuracy reaches 99.99235%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why not?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the after all the juiciest part of the job. &amp;ldquo;Solving&amp;rdquo; one dataset after another, it may seem like anything around you can be &lt;em>conquered&lt;/em> with a simple &lt;code>model.fit&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That was me two years ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The naive version of me thought that was all about it with machine learning (ML).
As long as we have a dataset, ML is the way to go.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PyTorch at the Edge: Deploying Over 964 TIMM Models on Android with TorchScript and Flutter</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/pytorch_at_the_edge_timm_torchscript_flutter/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 11:00:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/pytorch_at_the_edge_timm_torchscript_flutter/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="-motivation">🔥 Motivation&lt;/h3>
&lt;!-- You finally got into a Kaggle competition. You found a *getting-started notebook* written by a Kaggle Grandmaster and immediately trained a state-of-the-art (SOTA) image classification model.

After some fiddling, you found yourself in the leaderboard topping the charts with **99.9851247\% accuracy** on the test set 😎!

Proud of your achievement you reward yourself to some rest and a good night's sleep. 
And tomorrow it's time to move on to the next dataset (again). -->
&lt;!-- And then..

&lt;p>As a data scientist, you might be tempted to jump into modeling as soon as you can.
I mean, that&amp;rsquo;s the fun part, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But trust me, if you skip straight to modeling without taking the time to really
understand the problem and analyze the data, you&amp;rsquo;re setting yourself up for failure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might feel like a superstar, but you&amp;rsquo;ll have with a model that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work 🤦‍♂️.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
