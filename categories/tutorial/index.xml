&lt;p>Many biology and medical procedures involve counting cells from images taken with a microscope.
Counting cells reveals the concentration of bacteria and viruses and gives vital information on the progress of a disease.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To accomplish the counting, researchers painstakingly count the cells by hand with the assistance of a device called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWS9sZbGj6A&amp;amp;ab_channel=ThermoFisherScientific" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">hemocytometer&lt;/a>.
This process is repetitive, tedious, and prone to errors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>What if we could automate the counting by using an intelligent deep learning algorithm instead?&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploying Object Detection Models on Hugging Face Spaces</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/deploy_icevision_models_on_huggingface_spaces/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 13:42:56 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/deploy_icevision_models_on_huggingface_spaces/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>So, you’ve trained a deep learning model that can detect objects from images.
Next, how can you share the awesomeness of your model with the rest of the world?
You might be a PhD student trying to get some ideas from your peers or supervisors, or a startup founder who wishes to share a minimum viable product to your clients for feedback.
But, at the same time you don&amp;rsquo;t wish to go through the hassle of dealing with MLOps.
This blog post is for you. In this post I will walk you through how to deploy your model and share them to the world for free!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
