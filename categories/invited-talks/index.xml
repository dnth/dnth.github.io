Data Drift vs Concept Drift and Monitoring Machine Learning Model.
MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices for managing the lifecycle of machine learning models in production. It involves collaboration between data scientists, software engineers, and IT operations teams to automate and streamline the process of developing, deploying, and maintaining machine learning models.</description></item><item><title>Applications of Edge AI with Sage Elliot at Whylabs</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/talk_rsqrd_applications_edge_ai/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2022 20:48:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/talk_rsqrd_applications_edge_ai/</guid><description>âœ¨ Introduction Running AI on the Edge has become a widely discussed topic in the world of artificial intelligence. At its core, the concept of Edge AI involves putting AI algorithms as close to the user or data as possible. This is in contrast to the traditional server-based approach, where computations are carried out in remote servers, leading to slow response times and the need to transfer data back and forth.</description></item><item><title>ML Pipelines from the Get Go (Without Tears)</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/talk_ml_pipelines_from_the_get_go/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2022 20:48:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/talk_ml_pipelines_from_the_get_go/</guid><description>In this talk, I discuss one of the most important aspect of putting ML model into production - building a pipeline and why you should do it from the start.
The talk was hosted with FuzzyLabs and Skillsmatter.

However, these models often require high computational resources and can be slow when running on a CPU. This can pose a challenge for real-time applications, such as surveillance and security, where quick detection and analysis of objects is critical.</description></item><item><title>Leveraging Open Source Tools to Deploy Models (Without ðŸ˜¥)</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/talk_tfdl_deploying_dl_without_tears/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 20:48:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/talk_tfdl_deploying_dl_without_tears/</guid><description>ðŸ’¡ Introduction This talk was given to the Tensorflow Deep Learning Malaysia Facebook group during the June 2022 online meetup. The group had over 7.5k members consisting of audience from various background related to artificial intelligence in Malaysia.
The goal of the talk is to introduce the members to existing open-source tools they can use to deploy models on the cloud and edge.
Half of the audience has no experience with deep learning.</description></item></channel></rss>
