      #### Ph.D. in Engineering

      My Ph.D. work explores the effectiveness of using deep learning models to estimate
      state-of-charge (SOC) in the batteries of hybrid electric vehicles. The study conducts
      various in-depth comparative analyses of state-of-the-art deep learning methods
      applied to SOC estimation. The goal of the study is to develop a novel estimation
      algorithm that can accurately estimate the remaining charge from the drivers'
      driving patterns. This work proposes the use of a self-supervised Transformer model
      and yields low error metrics providing a promising alternative to conventional SOC estimation models.
      See our published Nature [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98915-8).

      #### Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering

      My Master's Degree work explores the idea of recognizing the behavior of humanoid robots using
      a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a variation of recurrent neural networks. The
      LSTM network is shown capable of classifying robotic maneuvers from joint angle
      data. See our published [paper](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1729881416663369) and demo [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_JIlfgBD_4&ab_channel=dicksonneoh).

      #### Bachelor of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (Honours)

      I graduated first class with a cumulative GPA of `3.71/4.00`.
      My bachelor's thesis explores the idea of using pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques in combination with PID control algorithms to control the torque of a brushed DC motor.
      I fabricated a custom printed circuit board (PCB) to proof the working principle of the motor driver.
      See our published [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705812027385).
