  ## My Expertises

  I'm an academic specializing in Deep Learning and Li-ion technology at [Malaysia National Energy University](https://www.uniten.edu.my/). 
  I have published a dozen scientific articles in a few reputable journals including [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98915-8) and [IEEE Transactions](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9276459) during my tenure as an academic. 
  Check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CBGCEskAAAAJ) and [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dickson-Neoh) profile. 
  I am a big fan of open source projects. During my free time I contribute to various projects on Github. Checkout my [GitHub](https://github.com/dnth) profile.

      #### PhD. in Engineering

      My PhD. work explores the effectiveness of using deep learning models to estimate
      state-of-charge (SOC) in the batteries of hybrid electric vehicles. The study conducts
      various in depth comparative analysis of state-of-the-art deep learning methods
      applied to SOC estimation. The goal of the study is to develop a novel estimation
      algorithm that can accurately estimate the remaining charge from the drivers'
      driving patterns. This work proposes the use of self-supervised Transformer model
      and yields low error metrics providing a promising alternative to conventional SOC estimation models.

      #### Master of Electrical Engineering

      My Masters Degree work explores the idea of recognizing the behavior of humanoid robots using
      a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a variation of recurrent neural networks. The
      LSTM network is shown capable of classifying robotic maneuvers from joint angle
      data. See our published [paper](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1729881416663369) and demo [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_JIlfgBD_4&ab_channel=dicksonneoh).

      #### Bachelor of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (Hons.)

      This work explored the idea of building a torque control DC motor driver using
      pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques in combination with PID control algorithms. See our published [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705812027385).
