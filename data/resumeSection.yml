  ## My Expertises

  I am currently an academic and  PhD. candidate in Engineering (graduating in 2022) and specializing in Deep Learning and Li-ion technology at Malaysia National Energy University. I have published scientific articles in a few reputable journals including [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98915-8) and [IEEE Transactions](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9276459) during my tenure as an academic.

      #### PhD. in Engineering

      This thesis explores the effectiveness of using deep learning algorithms to estimate
      state-of-charge (SOC) in the batteries of hybrid electric vehicles. The study conducts
      various in depth comparative analysis of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms
      applied to charge estimation. The goal of the study is to develop a novel estimation
      algorithm capable of learning to estimate the remaining charge from the drivers'
      driving behaviors. This thesis proposes the use of self-supervised Transformer model
      to estimate SOC.

      #### Master of Electrical Engineering

      This thesis explored the idea of recognizing the behavior of humanoid robots using
      a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a variation of recurrent neural networks. The
      LSTM network is shown capable of classifying robotic maneuvers from joint angle
      data
