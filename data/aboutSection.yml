  ## About me

  <img src="images/about/profile-infj.png" width="200">


  I'm an introvert - [INFJ](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality) according to the MBTI personality test. I enjoy reading self-development books on psychology, nutrition, biohacking and productivity. Among my favorites are Deep Work, Deep Nutrition, Quiet, Ultralearning, The Cancer Code, The Bulletproof Plan to Age Backward, and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. See all the books I've read [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/41784093-dickson-neoh?shelf=read).

  >> Other than reading I enjoy tinkering with electronics and coding in my free time. I've made Raspberry Pi-based electronic locks, Telegram bots to monitor crowd attendance, an Android app to broadcast live stream videos, and fixed old electronic board problems on televisions, ceiling fans, etc. I'm known as *the DIY tech guy* among my friends.
  
  >>> I'm an academic with a proven track record. I've published in reputable journals including [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98915-8), [Elsevier](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095965262034155X), and [IEEE Transactions](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9276459). See my publication list [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=CBGCEskAAAAJ). I've also helped companies design end-to-end deep learning solutions and deploy them into production. 

  >>>> 丘멆잺 I'm seeking **remote employment** opportunities as a *Data Scientist* or *Machine Learning Engineer*.
  If you know of any openings, I'd be forever grateful if you can [connect me](https://calendly.com/dickson-neoh/discovery-call).
