  ### I love to design, build and deploy Artificial Intelligence models

  I have worked extensively on cutting-edge deep convolutional neural networks for object detection and classification, 
  recurrent neural networks for time series classification, and self-supervised Transformer models for time series forecasting.
  I'm an active contributor to [IceVision](https://github.com/airctic/icevision) - An Object Detection Framework with deep learning, 
  [TSAI](https://github.com/timeseriesAI/tsai) - State-of-the-art deep learning package for time series and sequences, and [nine other](https://github.com/dnth) open-source projects.
