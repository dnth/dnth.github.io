  ## About me
  
  My name is Dickson Neoh from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I enjoy building machine learning-based solutions to help companies scale up their business.

  ### I love to design, build and deploy deep learning models.

  I have worked extensively on cutting-edge deep convolutional neural networks for object detection and classification, 
  recurrent neural networks for time series classification, and self-supervised Transformer models for time series forecasting.
  I'm a core developer of [IceVision](https://github.com/airctic/icevision) - An Object Detection Framework with deep learning, contributor to 
  [TSAI](https://github.com/timeseriesAI/tsai) - State-of-the-art deep learning package for time series and sequences, and [nine other](https://github.com/dnth) open-source projects.
