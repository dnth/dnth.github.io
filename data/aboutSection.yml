  ## About me

  I am a seasoned deep learning data scientist with a passion for using cutting-edge technology to drive real-world results. With years of experience in designing, building, and deploying advanced deep learning models, I've also helped companies design end-to-end deep learning solutions and deploy them into production.
  
  >>> Prior to joining the industry, I was an academic with a proven track record. I've published in reputable journals including [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98915-8), [Elsevier](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095965262034155X), and [IEEE Transactions](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9276459). See my publication list [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=CBGCEskAAAAJ). 
 
  >>>> I'm an introvert - [INFJ](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality) according to the [MBTI](https://www.16personalities.com/) personality test. I enjoy reading self-development books on psychology, nutrition, biohacking and productivity. Among my favorites are Deep Work, Deep Nutrition, Quiet, Ultralearning, The Cancer Code, The Bulletproof Plan to Age Backward, and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. See all the books I've read [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/41784093-dickson-neoh?shelf=read).

  >>>>> Other than reading I enjoy tinkering with electronics and coding in my free time. I've made Raspberry Pi-based electronic locks, Telegram bots to monitor crowd attendance, an Android app to broadcast live stream videos, and fixed old electronic board problems on televisions, ceiling fans, etc.
  
  >>>>>> I enjoy creating contents on practical deep learning [projects](https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio) for free - some of which had garnered over 400,000 views in the course of 6 weeks. 
  
  >>>>>>> Support me in pushing out more high-quality free contents.
