But let&amp;rsquo;s be real, it&amp;rsquo;s easy for our photo collections to become a chaotic mess, making it impossible to find that one special memory.
I mean, I&amp;rsquo;ve got gigabytes of photos on my Google Photo app filled with dark shots, overly exposed shots, blurry shots, and tons of duplicate stills.</description></item><item><title>PyTorch at the Edge: Deploying Over 964 TIMM Models on Android with TorchScript and Flutter</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/pytorch_at_the_edge_timm_torchscript_flutter/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 11:00:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/pytorch_at_the_edge_timm_torchscript_flutter/</guid><description>üî• Motivation With various high-level libraries like Keras, Transformer, and Fastai, the barrier to training SOTA models has never been lower.
On top of that with platforms like Google Colab and Kaggle, pretty much anyone can train a reasonably good model using an old laptop or even a mobile phone (with some patience).
The question is no longer &amp;ldquo;can we train a SOTA model?&amp;rdquo;, but &amp;ldquo;what happens after that?&amp;rdquo;
Unfortunately, after getting the model trained, most people wash their hands off at this point claiming their model works.</description></item><item><title>Fastdup: A Powerful Tool to Manage, Clean &amp; Curate Visual Data at Scale on Your CPU - For Free.</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/fastdup_manage_clean_curate/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 11:00:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/fastdup_manage_clean_curate/</guid><description>‚úÖ Motivation As a data scientist, you might be tempted to jump into modeling as soon as you can. I mean, that&amp;rsquo;s the fun part, right?
But trust me, if you skip straight to modeling without taking the time to really understand the problem and analyze the data, you&amp;rsquo;re setting yourself up for failure.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been there.
You might feel like a superstar, but you&amp;rsquo;ll have with a model that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</description></item><item><title>AI/ML Data Talks Podcast Episode 15</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/podcast_ai_ml_data_talks_episode_fifteen/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2022 20:48:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/podcast_ai_ml_data_talks_episode_fifteen/</guid><description>In this episode of the AI/ML talk I talked about some of the hottest topics in machine learning including What is MLOps? Data Drift vs Concept Drift and Monitoring Machine Learning Model.
MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices for managing the lifecycle of machine learning models in production. It involves collaboration between data scientists, software engineers, and IT operations teams to automate and streamline the process of developing, deploying, and maintaining machine learning models.</description></item><item><title>Applications of Edge AI with Sage Elliot at Whylabs</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/talk_rsqrd_applications_edge_ai/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2022 20:48:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/talk_rsqrd_applications_edge_ai/</guid><description>‚ú® Introduction Running AI on the Edge has become a widely discussed topic in the world of artificial intelligence. At its core, the concept of Edge AI involves putting AI algorithms as close to the user or data as possible. This is in contrast to the traditional server-based approach, where computations are carried out in remote servers, leading to slow response times and the need to transfer data back and forth.</description></item><item><title>ML Pipelines from the Get Go (Without Tears)</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/talk_ml_pipelines_from_the_get_go/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2022 20:48:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/talk_ml_pipelines_from_the_get_go/</guid><description>üí´ Takeaways In this talk, I discussed why ML pipelines should be built from the get-go. Here are some of the key takeaways:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Despite the hype around machine learning, 55% of companies have not deployed a single ML model yet, and those who have are struggling to maintain and scale them.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Putting ML in production is not just about ML, but also about engineering. Many companies are doing more engineering than ML to solve various issues that arise in the pipeline.</description></item><item><title>Cool Data Projects Show with Kristen - Gun Detection on CPU</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/talk_cool_data_science_cpu_pistol_detection/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2022 20:48:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/talk_cool_data_science_cpu_pistol_detection/</guid><description>üî• Introduction The rapid advancement in computer vision technology has led to the development of sophisticated models that can perform complex tasks, such as object detection and segmentation, with high accuracy. However, these models often require high computational resources and can be slow when running on a CPU. This can pose a challenge for real-time applications, such as surveillance and security, where quick detection and analysis of objects is critical.</description></item><item><title>Leveraging Open Source Tools to Deploy Models (Without üò•)</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/talk_tfdl_deploying_dl_without_tears/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 20:48:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/talk_tfdl_deploying_dl_without_tears/</guid><description>üí° Introduction This talk was given to the Tensorflow Deep Learning Malaysia Facebook group during the June 2022 online meetup. The group had over 7.5k members consisting of audience from various background related to artificial intelligence in Malaysia.
The goal of the talk is to introduce the members to existing open-source tools they can use to deploy models on the cloud and edge.
Half of the audience has no experience with deep learning.</description></item><item><title>Supercharging YOLOv5: How I Got 182.4 FPS Inference Without a GPU</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/supercharging_yolov5_180_fps_cpu/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 11:00:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/supercharging_yolov5_180_fps_cpu/</guid><description>üî• Motivation After months of searching, you&amp;rsquo;ve finally found the one.
The one object detection library that just works. No installation hassle, no package version mismatch, and no CUDA errors.

Install the Weights and Biases client and log the YOLOX training metrics. Compare training metrics on Weights and Biases dashboard. Picking the best model with mAP and FPS values. &amp;ldquo;So many models, so little time!&amp;rdquo;
As a machine learning engineer, I often hear this phrase thrown around in many variations.
In object detection alone, there are already several hundreds of models out there.</description></item><item><title>Faster than GPU: How to 10x your Object Detection Model and Deploy on CPU at 50+ FPS</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/how_to_10x_your_od_model_and_deploy_50fps_cpu/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2022 15:00:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/how_to_10x_your_od_model_and_deploy_50fps_cpu/</guid><description>üö¶ Motivation tip

Counting cells reveals the concentration of bacteria and viruses and gives vital information on the progress of a disease.
To accomplish the counting, researchers painstakingly count the cells by hand with the assistance of a device called hemocytometer. This process is repetitive, tedious, and prone to errors.
What if we could automate the counting by using an intelligent deep learning algorithm instead?</description></item><item><title>Contributing to open-source: Lessons learned</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/contributing_to_open_source_lessons_learned/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 20:48:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/contributing_to_open_source_lessons_learned/</guid><description>‚òÄÔ∏è Introduction I was recently given the recognition by the folks at IceVision to be part of the core-developer team!
