This trend is expected to continue further this year in 2022.
Despite huge efforts in research, machine learning models often fail in the deployment.
What exactly is deployment? In simple terms, deployment means making a model&amp;rsquo;s capability or insight available to users or other systems - Luigi Patruno. Only when a model is deployed can they add value to businesses or organizations</description></item><item><title>Training a Deep Learning Model for Cell Counting in 17 Lines of Code with 17 Images</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/training_dl_model_for_cell_counting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 15:07:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/training_dl_model_for_cell_counting/</guid><description>üï∂Ô∏è Motivation Numerous biology and medical procedures involve counting cells from images taken with a microscope. Counting cells reveals the concentration of bacteria and viruses and gives vital information on the progress of a disease. To accomplish the counting, researchers painstakingly count the cells by hand with the assistance of a device called hemocytometer. This process is repetitive, tedious, and prone to errors.
What if we could automate the counting by using an intelligent deep learning algorithm instead?</description></item><item><title>Real-time Vehicle and License Plate Detection with Tensorflow and OpenVINO</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/realtime_vehicle_and_license_plate_detection_with_openvino/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2022 15:07:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/realtime_vehicle_and_license_plate_detection_with_openvino/</guid><description>Motivation In this work we showcase a real-time vehicle and license plate detection using

Next, how can you share the awesomeness of your model with the rest of the world? You might be a PhD student trying to get some ideas from your peers or supervisors, or a startup founder who wishes to share a minimum viable product to your clients for feedback. But, at the same time you don&amp;rsquo;t wish to go through the hassle of dealing with MLOps.</description></item></channel></rss>
