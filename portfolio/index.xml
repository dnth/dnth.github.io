Making a model available to users or other systems - Luigi. https://mlinproduction.com/what-does-it-mean-to-deploy-a-machine-learning-model-deployment-series-01/
MLOps - messy - hundreds of tools and no accepted standard of practice.

ML model adds value to a business or organization when it can make its prediction available to users. This is where deployment comes in. 80 percent of models don&amp;rsquo;t make it into prod.
Deploying deep learning model on the edge is not trivial.</description></item><item><title>Training a Deep Learning Model for Cell Counting in 17 Lines of Code with 17 Images</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/training_dl_model_for_cell_counting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 15:07:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/training_dl_model_for_cell_counting/</guid><description>üï∂Ô∏è Motivation Numerous biology and medical procedures involve counting cells from images taken with a microscope. Counting cells reveals the concentration of bacteria and viruses and gives vital information on the progress of a disease. To accomplish the counting, researchers painstakingly count the cells by hand with the assistance of a device called hemocytometer. This process is repetitive, tedious, and prone to errors.
What if we could automate the counting by using an intelligent deep learning algorithm instead?</description></item><item><title>Real-time Vehicle and License Plate Detection with Tensorflow and OpenVINO</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/realtime_vehicle_and_license_plate_detection_with_openvino/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2022 15:07:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/realtime_vehicle_and_license_plate_detection_with_openvino/</guid><description>Motivation In this work we showcase a real-time vehicle and license plate detection using
