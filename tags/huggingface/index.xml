Next, how can you share the awesomeness of your model with the rest of the world? You might be a PhD student trying to get some ideas from your peers or supervisors, or a startup founder who wishes to share a minimum viable product to your clients for feedback. But, at the same time you don&amp;rsquo;t wish to go through the hassle of dealing with MLOps.</description></item><item><title>MicroSense - A deep learning powered cell counting app with Flutter</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/counting_microalgaes_with_microsense/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 15:07:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/counting_microalgaes_with_microsense/</guid><description>Motivation Numerous biology and medical procedure involve counting cells from images taken with microscope. Counting cells reveals the concentration of bacteria and viruses and gives vital information on the progress of a disease. Uses hemocytometer or a counting chamber. Creates volumetric grid for accurate counting. Done properly can be accurate. Don&amp;rsquo;t require sophisticated instrument can be easily performed. Image shows a sample image from a hemocytometer.
Microbiologist often count cells manually this is a method known as direct counting.</description></item></channel></rss>
