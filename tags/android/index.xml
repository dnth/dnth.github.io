Why not?
This is the after all the juiciest part of the job. &amp;ldquo;Solving&amp;rdquo; one dataset after another, it may seem like anything around you can be conquered with a simple model.fit.
That was me two years ago.
The naive version of me thought that was all about it with machine learning (ML).</description></item><item><title>PyTorch at the Edge: Deploying Over 964 TIMM Models on Android with TorchScript and Flutter</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/pytorch_at_the_edge_timm_torchscript_flutter/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 11:00:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/pytorch_at_the_edge_timm_torchscript_flutter/</guid><description>ðŸ”¥ Motivation With various high-level libraries like Keras, Transformer, and Fastai, the barrier to training SOTA models has never been lower.
On top of that with platforms like Google Colab and Kaggle, pretty much anyone can train a reasonably good model using an old laptop or even a mobile phone (with some patience).
The question is no longer &amp;ldquo;can we train a SOTA model?&amp;rdquo;, but &amp;ldquo;what happens after that?&amp;rdquo;
Unfortunately, after getting the model trained, most people wash their hands off at this point claiming their model works.</description></item><item><title>How to Deploy Object Detection Models on Android with Flutter</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/how_to_deploy_od_models_on_android_with_flutter/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2022 15:00:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/how_to_deploy_od_models_on_android_with_flutter/</guid><description>ðŸš‘ Deployment: Where ML models go to die In this post, I will outline the basic steps to deploy ML models onto lightweight mobile devices easily, quickly and for free.

By the end of this post, you will learn about:
Leveraging Hugging Face infrastructure to host models. Deploying on any edge device using REST API. Displaying the results on a Flutter Android app. According to Gartner, more than 85% of machine learning (ML) models never made it into production.</description></item></channel></rss>
