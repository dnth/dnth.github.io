This allows for real-time analysis and decision making without the latency and bandwidth limitations of sending data back and forth to a central location.
Edge AI is important because it enables IoT devices, such as cameras and sensors, to process data locally and respond quickly to changing conditions without relying on a constant connection to the cloud.</description></item><item><title>ML Pipelines from the Get Go (Without Tears)</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/talk_ml_pipelines_from_the_get_go/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2022 20:48:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/talk_ml_pipelines_from_the_get_go/</guid><description>In this talk, I discuss one of the most important aspect of putting ML model into production - building a pipeline and why you should do it from the start.

The group had over 7.5k members consisting of audience from various background related to artificial intelligence in Malaysia.
The goal of the talk is to introduce the members to existing open-source tools they can use to deploy models on the cloud and edge.
Half of the audience has no experience with deep learning.</description></item></channel></rss>
