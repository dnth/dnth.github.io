The group had over 7.5k members consisting of audience from various background related to artificial intelligence in Malaysia.
The goal of the talk is to introduce the members to existing open-source tools they can use to deploy models on the cloud and edge.
Half of the audience has no experience with deep learning.</description></item></channel></rss>
