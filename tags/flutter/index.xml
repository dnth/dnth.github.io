You found a getting-started notebook written by a Kaggle Grandmaster and immediately trained a state-of-the-art (SOTA) image classification model.
After some fiddling, you found yourself in the leaderboard topping the charts with 99.9851247% accuracy on the test set ðŸ˜Ž!
Proud of your achievement you reward yourself to some rest and a good night&amp;rsquo;s sleep.
And then..
With various high level libraries like Keras, Transformer and Fastai, the barrier to SOTA models have never been lower.</description></item><item><title>How to Deploy Object Detection Models on Android with Flutter</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/how_to_deploy_od_models_on_android_with_flutter/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2022 15:00:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/how_to_deploy_od_models_on_android_with_flutter/</guid><description>ðŸš‘ Deployment: Where ML models go to die In this post, I will outline the basic steps to deploy ML models onto lightweight mobile devices easily, quickly and for free.
tip
By the end of this post, you will learn about:
Leveraging Hugging Face infrastructure to host models. Deploying on any edge device using REST API. Displaying the results on a Flutter Android app. According to Gartner, more than 85% of machine learning (ML) models never made it into production.</description></item></channel></rss>
