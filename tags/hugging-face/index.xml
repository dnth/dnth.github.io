By the end of this post you will learn how to:
Set up a Telegram bot with a Python wrapper library. Use the Gradio API to access the GPT-J model prediction. Host the Telegram bot on Hugging Face Spaces. By the end of this post, you&amp;rsquo;ll have your own Telegram bot that has access to the GPT-J-6B model. All for free.
Deploying a state-of-the-art (SOTA) GPT-like language model on a chatbot can be tricky.</description></item><item><title>How to Deploy Object Detection Models on Android with Flutter</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/how_to_deploy_od_models_on_android_with_flutter/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2022 15:00:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/how_to_deploy_od_models_on_android_with_flutter/</guid><description>ðŸš‘ Deployment: Where ML models go to die In this post, I will outline the basic steps to deploy ML models onto lightweight mobile devices easily, quickly and for free.
tip
By the end of this post, you will learn about:
Leveraging Hugging Face infrastructure to host models. Deploying on any edge device using REST API. Displaying the results on a Flutter Android app. According to Gartner, more than 85% of machine learning (ML) models never made it into production.</description></item><item><title>Bringing High-Quality Image Models to Mobile: Hugging Face TIMM Meets Android &amp; iOS</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/bringing_high_quality_image_models_to_mobile/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Feb 2022 11:00:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/bringing_high_quality_image_models_to_mobile/</guid><description>info
This blog post is still a work in progress. If you require further clarifications before the contents are finalized, please get in touch with me here, on LinkedIn, or Twitter. ðŸŒŸ Motivation For many data scientist (including myself), we pride ourselves in training a model, seeing the loss graph go down, and claim victory when the test set accuracy reaches 99.99235%.
Why not?
This is the after all the juiciest part of the job.</description></item><item><title>Deploying Object Detection Models on Hugging Face Spaces</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/deploy_icevision_models_on_huggingface_spaces/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 13:42:56 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/deploy_icevision_models_on_huggingface_spaces/</guid><description>Introduction So, youâ€™ve trained a deep learning model that can detect objects from images. Next, how can you share the awesomeness of your model with the rest of the world? You might be a PhD student trying to get some ideas from your peers or supervisors, or a startup founder who wishes to share a minimum viable product to your clients for feedback. But, at the same time you don&amp;rsquo;t wish to go through the hassle of dealing with MLOps.</description></item></channel></rss>
