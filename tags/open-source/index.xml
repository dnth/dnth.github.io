Data Drift vs Concept Drift and Monitoring Machine Learning Model.
MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices for managing the lifecycle of machine learning models in production. It involves collaboration between data scientists, software engineers, and IT operations teams to automate and streamline the process of developing, deploying, and maintaining machine learning models.</description></item><item><title>Applications of Edge AI with Sage Elliot at Whylabs</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/talk_rsqrd_applications_edge_ai/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2022 20:48:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/talk_rsqrd_applications_edge_ai/</guid><description>Edge AI refers to the deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms and models at the edge of the network, closer to the source of data, rather than in a centralized cloud or data center. This allows for real-time analysis and decision making without the latency and bandwidth limitations of sending data back and forth to a central location.
Edge AI is important because it enables IoT devices, such as cameras and sensors, to process data locally and respond quickly to changing conditions without relying on a constant connection to the cloud.</description></item><item><title>ML Pipelines from the Get Go (Without Tears)</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/talk_ml_pipelines_from_the_get_go/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2022 20:48:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/talk_ml_pipelines_from_the_get_go/</guid><description>In this talk, I discuss one of the most important aspect of putting ML model into production - building a pipeline and why you should do it from the start.
The talk was hosted with FuzzyLabs and Skillsmatter.

The group had over 7.5k members consisting of audience from various background related to artificial intelligence in Malaysia.
The goal of the talk is to introduce the members to existing open-source tools they can use to deploy models on the cloud and edge.
Half of the audience has no experience with deep learning.</description></item><item><title>Contributing to open-source: Lessons learned</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/contributing_to_open_source_lessons_learned/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 20:48:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/contributing_to_open_source_lessons_learned/</guid><description>‚òÄÔ∏è Introduction I was recently given the recognition by the folks at IceVision to be part of the core-developer team! Farid Hassainia, a co-creator of the IceVision Tweeted about it on March 17, 2022. We are super excited to introduce you to our üéâNew Core-Dev: Dickson Neoh @dicksonneoh7
Dickson is actively contributing to IceVision. He ardently helps IceVision users in our Discord Community.
We are very happy to have him on our team!</description></item></channel></rss>
