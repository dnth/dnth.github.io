In some domain, a 1-second delay in inference could mean life or death.
Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re sitting in a self-driving car and the car takes one full second to detect an oncoming truck.
Just one second too late, and you could end up in the clouds ðŸ‘¼ðŸ‘¼ðŸ‘¼
Or if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky, on the ground.
I hope that shows you how crucial this problem is.</description></item><item><title>Supercharging YOLOv5: How I Got 182.4 FPS Inference Without a GPU</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/supercharging_yolov5_180_fps_cpu/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 11:00:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/supercharging_yolov5_180_fps_cpu/</guid><description>ðŸ”¥ Motivation After months of searching, you&amp;rsquo;ve finally found the one.
The one object detection library that just works. No installation hassle, no package version mismatch, and no CUDA errors.
I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the amazingly engineered YOLOv5 object detection library by Ultralytics.
Elated, you quickly find an interesting dataset from Roboflow and finally trained a state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLOv5 model to detect firearms from image streams.
You ran through a quick checklist &amp;ndash;</description></item><item><title>Faster than GPU: How to 10x your Object Detection Model and Deploy on CPU at 50+ FPS</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/how_to_10x_your_od_model_and_deploy_50fps_cpu/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2022 15:00:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/how_to_10x_your_od_model_and_deploy_50fps_cpu/</guid><description>ðŸš¦ Motivation tip
By the end of this post, you will learn how to:
Train state-of-the-art YOLOX model with your own data. Convert the YOLOX PyTorch model into ONNX and OpenVINO IR format. Run quantization algorithm to 10x your model&amp;rsquo;s inference speed. P/S: The final model runs faster on the CPU than the GPU! ðŸ˜±
Deep learning (DL), seems to be the magic word that makes anything mundane cool again. We find them everywhere - in news reports, blog posts, articles, research papers, advertisements, and even baby books.</description></item></channel></rss>
