&lt;p>For many data scientist (including myself), we pride ourselves in training a model, seeing the loss graph go down, and claim victory when the test set accuracy reaches 99.99235%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why not?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the after all the juiciest part of the job. &amp;ldquo;Solving&amp;rdquo; one dataset after another, it may seem like anything around you can be &lt;em>conquered&lt;/em> with a simple &lt;code>model.fit&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
