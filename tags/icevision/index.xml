Counting cells reveals the concentration of bacteria and viruses and gives vital information on the progress of a disease. To accomplish the counting, researchers painstakingly count the cells by hand with the assistance of a device called hemocytometer. This process is repetitive, tedious, and prone to errors.
What if we could automate the counting by using an intelligent deep learning algorithm instead?</description></item><item><title>Deploy IceVision Models on HuggingFace Spaces</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/deploy_icevision_models_on_huggingface_spaces/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 13:42:56 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/deploy_icevision_models_on_huggingface_spaces/</guid><description>Introduction So, you‚Äôve trained a deep learning model that can detect objects from images. Next, how can you share the awesomeness of your model with the rest of the world? You might be a PhD student trying to get some ideas from your peers or supervisors, or a startup founder who wishes to share a minimum viable product to your clients for feedback. But, at the same time you don&amp;rsquo;t wish to go through the hassle of dealing with MLOps.</description></item></channel></rss>
