Counting cells reveals the concentration of bacteria and viruses and gives vital information on the progress of a disease. To accomplish the counting, researchers painstakingly count the cells by hand with the assistance of a device called hemocytometer. This process is repetitive, tedious, and prone to errors.
What if we could automate the counting by using an intelligent deep learning algorithm instead?</description></item><item><title>Contributing to open-source: Lessons learned</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/contributing_to_open_source_lessons_learned/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 20:48:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/contributing_to_open_source_lessons_learned/</guid><description>‚òÄÔ∏è Introduction I was recently given the recognition by the folks at IceVision to be part of the core-developer team! Farid Hassainia, a co-creator of the IceVision Tweeted about it on March 17, 2022. We are super excited to introduce you to our üéâNew Core-Dev: Dickson Neoh @dicksonneoh7
Dickson is actively contributing to IceVision. He ardently helps IceVision users in our Discord Community.
We are very happy to have him on our team!</description></item><item><title>Deploy IceVision Models on HuggingFace Spaces</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/deploy_icevision_models_on_huggingface_spaces/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 13:42:56 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/blog/deploy_icevision_models_on_huggingface_spaces/</guid><description>Introduction So, you‚Äôve trained a deep learning model that can detect objects from images. Next, how can you share the awesomeness of your model with the rest of the world? You might be a PhD student trying to get some ideas from your peers or supervisors, or a startup founder who wishes to share a minimum viable product to your clients for feedback. But, at the same time you don&amp;rsquo;t wish to go through the hassle of dealing with MLOps.</description></item></channel></rss>
