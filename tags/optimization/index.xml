The one object detection library that just works. No installation hassle, no package version mismatch, and no CUDA errors.
I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the amazingly engineered YOLOv5 object detection library by Ultralytics.
Elated, you quickly find an interesting dataset from Roboflow and finally trained a state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLOv5 model to detect firearms from image streams.
You ran through a quick checklist &amp;ndash;</description></item><item><title>Squeezing the Best Performance Out of YOLOX with Weights and Biases</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/comparing_yolox_models_weights_and_biases/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2022 11:00:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/comparing_yolox_models_weights_and_biases/</guid><description>ðŸ”Ž Motivation tip
By the end of this post you will learn how to:
Install the Weights and Biases client and log the YOLOX training metrics. Compare training metrics on Weights and Biases dashboard. Picking the best model with mAP and FPS values. &amp;ldquo;So many models, so little time!&amp;rdquo;
As a machine learning engineer, I often hear this phrase thrown around in many variations.
In object detection alone, there are already several hundreds of models out there.</description></item><item><title>Faster than GPU: How to 10x your Object Detection Model and Deploy on CPU at 50+ FPS</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/how_to_10x_your_od_model_and_deploy_50fps_cpu/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2022 15:00:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/how_to_10x_your_od_model_and_deploy_50fps_cpu/</guid><description>ðŸš¦ Motivation tip
By the end of this post, you will learn how to:
Train state-of-the-art YOLOX model with your own data. Convert the YOLOX PyTorch model into ONNX and OpenVINO IR format. Run quantization algorithm to 10x your model&amp;rsquo;s inference speed. P/S: The final model runs faster on the CPU than the GPU! ðŸ˜±
Deep learning (DL), seems to be the magic word that makes anything mundane cool again. We find them everywhere - in news reports, blog posts, articles, research papers, advertisements, and even baby books.</description></item><item><title>TIMM at the Edge: Deploying Over 964 PyTorch Image Models on Android with TorchScript and Flutter</title><link>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/timm_torchscript_flutter/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 11:00:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/timm_torchscript_flutter/</guid><description>info
This blog post is still a work in progress. If you require further clarifications before the contents are finalized, please get in touch with me here, on LinkedIn, or Twitter. ðŸ”¥ Motivation You finally got into a Kaggle competition. You found a getting-started notebook written by a Kaggle Grandmaster and immediately trained a state-of-the-art (SOTA) image classification model.
After some fiddling, you found yourself in the leaderboard topping the charts with 99.</description></item></channel></rss>
